## [0.12.0] - 2020-09-12

**IMPORTANT**: If you are upgrading from a previous version, please install the latest version of the CLI `go get -u github.com/hibiken/asynq/tools/asynq` and run `asynq migrate` command. No process should be writing to Redis while you run the migration command.

## The semantics of queue have changed

Previously, we called tasks that are ready to be processed _"Enqueued tasks"_, and other tasks that are scheduled to be processed in the future _"Scheduled tasks"_, etc.
We changed the semantics of _"Enqueue"_ slightly; All tasks that client pushes to Redis are _Enqueued_ to a queue. Within a queue, tasks will transition from one state to another.
Possible task states are:

- `Pending`: task is ready to be processed (previously called "Enqueued")
- `Active`: tasks is currently being processed (previously called "InProgress")
- `Scheduled`: task is scheduled to be processed in the future
- `Retry`: task failed to be processed and will be retried again in the future
- `Dead`: task has exhausted all of its retries and stored for manual inspection purpose

**These semantics change is reflected in the new `Inspector` API and CLI commands.**

---

### Changed

#### `Client`

Use `ProcessIn` or `ProcessAt` option to schedule a task instead of `EnqueueIn` or `EnqueueAt`.

| Previously                  | v0.12.0                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `client.EnqueueAt(t, task)` | `client.Enqueue(task, asynq.ProcessAt(t))` |
| `client.EnqueueIn(d, task)` | `client.Enqueue(task, asynq.ProcessIn(d))` |

#### `Inspector`

All Inspector methods are scoped to a queue, and the methods take `qname (string)` as the first argument.
`EnqueuedTask` is renamed to `PendingTask` and its corresponding methods.
`InProgressTask` is renamed to `ActiveTask` and its corresponding methods.
Command "Enqueue" is replaced by the verb "Run" (e.g. `EnqueueAllScheduledTasks` --> `RunAllScheduledTasks`)

#### `CLI`

CLI commands are restructured to use subcommands. Commands are organized into a few management commands:
To view details on any command, use `asynq help <command> <subcommand>`.

- `asynq stats`
- `asynq queue [ls inspect history rm pause unpause]`
- `asynq task [ls cancel delete kill run delete-all kill-all run-all]`
- `asynq server [ls]`

### Added

#### `RedisConnOpt`

- `RedisClusterClientOpt` is added to connect to Redis Cluster.

- `ClusterKeySlot(qname string) (int64, error)` method is added to get queue's hash slot in Redis cluster.
- `ClusterNodes(qname string) ([]ClusterNode, error)` method is added to get a list of Redis cluster nodes for the given queue.

  you have tasks enqueued with the previous version of asynq.
- API of `(*Client).Enqueue`, `(*Client).EnqueueIn`, and `(*Client).EnqueueAt` has changed to return a `*Result`.
